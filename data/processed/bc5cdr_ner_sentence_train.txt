The X X O

several X X O

is X X O
also X X O
associated X X O
with X X O
chronic X X B-DIS

and X X O
ESRD X X B-DIS
, X X O
with X X O
a X X O
relative X X O
risk X X O
in X X O
the X X O
range X X O
of X X O
2 X X O
to X X O
4 X X O
. X X O

These X X O
studies X X O
suggest X X O
that X X O
both X X O
phenacetin X X B-CHEM
and X X O
acetaminophen X X B-CHEM
may X X O
contribute X X O
to X X O
the X X O
burden X X O
of X X O
ESRD X X B-DIS
, X X O
with X X O
the X X O
risk X X O
of X X O
the X X O
latter X X O
being X X O
somewhat X X O
less X X O
than X X O
that X X O
of X X O
the X X O
former X X O
. X X O

This X X O
apparent X X O
difference X X O
in X X O
risk X X O
may X X O
not X X O
be X X O
due X X O
to X X O
differences X X O
in X X O
nephrotoxic X X B-DIS
potential X X O
of X X O
the X X O
drugs X X O
themselves X X O
. X X O

A X X O
lower X X O
relative X X O
risk X X O
would X X O
be X X O
expected X X O
for X X O
acetaminophen X X B-CHEM
if X X O
the X X O
risk X X O
of X X O
both X X O
drugs X X O
in X X O
combination X X O
with X X O
other X X O
analgesics X X O
was X X O
higher X X O
than X X O
the X X O
risk X X O
of X X O
either X X O
agent X X O
alone X X O
. X X O

Thus X X O
, X X O
acetaminophen X X B-CHEM
has X X O
been X X O
used X X O
both X X O
as X X O
a X X O
single X X O
agent X X O
and X X O
in X X O

analgesics X X O
, X X O
whereas X X O
phenacetin X X B-CHEM
was X X O
available X X O
only X X O
in X X O

. X X O

The X X O
possibility X X O
that X X O
habitual X X O
use X X O
of X X O
acetaminophen X X B-CHEM

increases X X O
the X X O
risk X X O

ESRD X X B-DIS
has X X O
not X X O

This X X O

that X X O

INTERPRETATION X X O
: X X O

Although X X O
the X X O

mechanism X X O
of X X O

suggest X X O
that X X O

The X X O

that X X O

not X X O

This X X O

determined X X O

Furthermore X X O
, X X O
it X X O
was X X O
observed X X O
that X X O

thus X X O

Hemolysis X X B-DIS
caused X X O
by X X O
TAM X X B-CHEM
was X X O
not X X O

by X X O
the X X O

However X X O
, X X O
TAM X X B-CHEM
induces X X O

Either X X O

and X X O
prevents X X O

. X X O

These X X O
effects X X O
suggest X X O
that X X O
the X X O
protection X X O
from X X O

by X X O

is X X O
related X X O
to X X O

is X X O
consequently X X O
avoided X X O
. X X O

Therefore X X O
, X X O
TAM X X B-CHEM
- X X O
induced X X O
hemolysis X X B-DIS
results X X O
from X X O
a X X O
structural X X O
perturbation X X O

leading X X O

caused X X O
by X X O
its X X O
high X X O
partition X X O
in X X O
the X X O

. X X O

These X X O
defects X X O
explain X X O
the X X O
abnormal X X O

and X X O
decreased X X O

We X X O
have X X O
encountered X X O

between X X O
the X X O

of X X O

METHODS X X O

We X X O

In X X O
these X X O

When X X O

that X X O

The X X O
aims X X O

were X X O
to X X O

The X X O

RESULTS X X O
: X X O

: X X O
This X X O

The X X O

The X X O

BACKGROUND X X O
: X X O
Glioblastoma X X B-DIS
is X X O
a X X O
malignant X X B-DIS
tumor X X I-DIS
that X X O
occurs X X O
in X X O
the X X O
cerebrum X X O
during X X O
adulthood X X O
. X X O

With X X O
current X X O
treatment X X O
regimens X X O
including X X O
combined X X O
surgery X X O
, X X O

and X X O

, X X O
the X X O
average X X O

of X X O
the X X O
patients X X O
is X X O
limited X X O
to X X O
approximately X X O
1 X X O

. X X O

Therefore X X O
, X X O
patients X X O
with X X O
glioblastoma X X B-DIS
sometimes X X O
have X X O
intracarotid X X O

of X X O

Generally X X O

are X X O

. X X O

However X X O
, X X O
we X X O

CONCLUSION X X O
: X X O
When X X O

that X X O
an X X O

induced X X O
a X X O
pronounced X X O
increment X X O
of X X O

and X X O

whereas X X O
no X X O

was X X O
observed X X O
on X X O
the X X O
level X X O
of X X O

Pretreatment X X O

In X X O
addition X X O
, X X O
a X X O
statistically X X O

was X X O
also X X O
observed X X O
on X X O
the X X O

Based X X O
on X X O
the X X O
finding X X O
that X X O

could X X O
protect X X O

it X X O
is X X O
suggested X X O
that X X O
the X X O
reduction X X O
of X X O

was X X O
comparatively X X O

by X X O

Therefore X X O
, X X O
like X X O

, X X O
the X X O
finding X X O
that X X O

could X X O

- X X O

in X X O

should X X O
account X X O

The X X O
role X X O
of X X O
nicotine X X B-CHEM
in X X O
smoking X X O
- X X O
related X X O
cardiovascular X X B-DIS
disease X X I-DIS
. X X O

Nicotine X X B-CHEM
activates X X O
the X X O
sympathetic X X O
nervous X X O
system X X O
and X X O
in X X O
this X X O
way X X O
could X X O
contribute X X O
to X X O
cardiovascular X X B-DIS
disease X X I-DIS
. X X O

Animal X X O
studies X X O
and X X O
mechanistic X X O
studies X X O
indicate X X O
that X X O
nicotine X X B-CHEM
could X X O
play X X O
a X X O
role X X O
in X X O
accelerating X X O
atherosclerosis X X B-DIS
, X X O
but X X O
evidence X X O
among X X O

is X X O
too X X O

to X X O
be X X O
definitive X X O
about X X O
such X X O
an X X O
effect X X O
. X X O

Almost X X O
certainly X X O
, X X O
nicotine X X B-CHEM
via X X O
its X X O
hemodynamic X X O
effects X X O
contributes X X O
to X X O
acute X X O

, X X O
although X X O
current X X O
evidence X X O
suggests X X O
that X X O
the X X O
effects X X O
of X X O
nicotine X X B-CHEM
are X X O
much X X O
less X X O
important X X O
than X X O
are X X O
the X X O
prothrombotic X X O
effects X X O
of X X O
cigarette X X O

or X X O
the X X O
effects X X O
of X X O
carbon X X B-CHEM

. X X O

Nicotine X X B-CHEM
does X X O
not X X O
appear X X O
to X X O
enhance X X O
thrombosis X X B-DIS
among X X O
humans X X O
. X X O

Clinical X X O
studies X X O
of X X O
pipe X X O
smokers X X O
and X X O
people X X O
using X X O
transdermal X X O
nicotine X X B-CHEM
support X X O
the X X O
idea X X O
that X X O
toxins X X O
other X X O

are X X O
the X X O
most X X O
important X X O
causes X X O
of X X O

Finally X X O
, X X O
the X X O

that X X O

that X X O

, X X O
one X X O
drawback X X O
of X X O
such X X O

The X X O

: X X O
Recently X X O

have X X O
been X X O
found X X O
to X X O
cause X X O
acute X X O
hemolysis X X B-DIS

We X X O
aimed X X O
to X X O
investigate X X O
whether X X O
there X X O
is X X O
a X X O

can X X O

RESULTS X X O
: X X O
We X X O
observed X X O

In X X O

the X X O
