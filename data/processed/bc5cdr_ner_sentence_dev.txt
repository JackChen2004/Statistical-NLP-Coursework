Despite X X O

, X X O
both X X O
of X X O
which X X O
the X X O

, X X O
can X X O

also X X O
cause X X O

has X X O
a X X O
potential X X O
for X X O

these X X O

The X X O

suggested X X O
that X X O

was X X O
the X X O
cause X X O
of X X O
the X X O

. X X O

Pemoline X X B-CHEM

to X X O
the X X O

after X X O
found X X O
playing X X O
with X X O
a X X O
an X X O
empty X X O
bottle X X O
of X X O
pemoline X X B-CHEM
originally X X O
containing X X O
59 X X O

. X X O

The X X O
children X X O
had X X O
a X X O
medical X X O
history X X O
significant X X O
for X X O

previously X X O
treated X X O
with X X O

. X X O

This X X O
was X X O
their X X O
first X X O
day X X O
of X X O
pemoline X X B-CHEM
therapy X X O
. X X O

The X X O
choreoathetoid X X B-DIS
movements X X O
began X X O
45 X X O

to X X O
1 X X O

after X X O

. X X O

The X X O
children X X O
gave X X O
no X X O

of X X O
prior X X O
movement X X B-DIS

and X X O
there X X O
was X X O
no X X O

history X X O
of X X O

. X X O

The X X O
children X X O
received X X O

of X X O

Despite X X O

, X X O
the X X O
children X X O
continued X X O
to X X O
have X X O
choreoathetosis X X B-DIS
for X X O
approximately X X O
24 X X O

CONCLUSION X X O
: X X O
Pemoline X X B-CHEM

has X X O
been X X O
rarely X X O
reported X X O
in X X O
the X X O
acute X X O
toxicology X X O
literature X X O
. X X O

The X X O
possibility X X O
of X X O
choreoathetoid X X B-DIS
movements X X O
should X X O
be X X O
considered X X O
in X X O
patients X X O
presenting X X O
after X X O
pemoline X X B-CHEM
overdose X X B-DIS
. X X O

Continuous X X O

administration X X O
of X X O

to X X O
prevent X X O

- X X O
induced X X O

. X X O

Hemorrhagic X X B-DIS
cystitis X X I-DIS
is X X O
a X X O
major X X O
potential X X O
toxicity X X B-DIS
of X X O
ifosfamide X X B-CHEM
that X X O
can X X O
be X X O
prevented X X O
by X X O
administering X X O
mesna X X B-CHEM
along X X O
with X X O
the X X O
cytotoxic X X O
agent X X O
. X X O

Mesna X X B-CHEM
is X X O
generally X X O
administered X X O
by X X O
the X X O
intravenous X X O
route X X O
, X X O
although X X O
experience X X O
with X X O
oral X X O
delivery X X O
of X X O
the X X O
drug X X O
has X X O
increased X X O
. X X O

The X X O
continuous X X O
subcutaneous X X O
administration X X O
of X X O
mesna X X B-CHEM
has X X O
the X X O
advantage X X O
of X X O
not X X O
requiring X X O
intravenous X X O
access X X O
. X X O

In X X O
addition X X O
, X X O
subcutaneous X X O
delivery X X O
of X X O
the X X O
neutralizing X X O
agent X X O
will X X O
not X X O
be X X O
associated X X O
with X X O
the X X O
risk X X O
of X X O
inadequate X X O
urinary X X O
mesna X X B-CHEM
concentrations X X O
, X X O
such X X O
as X X O
in X X O
a X X O
patient X X O
taking X X O
oral X X O
mesna X X B-CHEM
who X X O
experiences X X O
severe X X O
ifosfamide X X B-CHEM
- X X O
induced X X O
emesis X X B-DIS
and X X O
is X X O
unable X X O
to X X O
absorb X X O
the X X O
drug X X O
. X X O

Limited X X O
clinical X X O
experience X X O
with X X O
continuous X X O
subcutaneous X X O
mesna X X B-CHEM
administration X X O
suggests X X O
it X X O
is X X O
a X X O
safe X X O
, X X O
practical X X O
, X X O
and X X O
economic X X O
method X X O
of X X O
drug X X O
delivery X X O
that X X O
permits X X O
ifosfamide X X B-CHEM
to X X O
be X X O
administered X X O
successfully X X O
in X X O
the X X O
outpatient X X O
setting X X O
. X X O

Modification X X O
of X X O

by X X O
hyperammonemia X X B-DIS
. X X O

Pretreatment X X O
with X X O

and X X O
similarly X X O
increased X X O

, X X O
but X X O
NH4Ac X X B-CHEM
treatment X X O

had X X O
no X X O

. X X O

Thus X X O
, X X O
hyperammonemia X X B-DIS
is X X O
capable X X O
of X X O
altering X X O
drug X X O
action X X O
and X X O
must X X O
be X X O
considered X X O
along X X O

These X X O

suggested X X O
that X X O

that X X O

exerts X X O
a X X O

that X X O

BACKGROUND X X O
: X X O
Tamoxifen X X B-CHEM
is X X O
a X X O
candidate X X O
chemopreventive X X O
agent X X O
in X X O
breast X X B-DIS
cancer X X I-DIS
, X X O
although X X O
the X X O

may X X O
be X X O
associated X X O
with X X O
the X X O
development X X O
of X X O
endometrial X X B-DIS
cancer X X I-DIS
. X X O

Therefore X X O
we X X O
did X X O
a X X O
trial X X O
in X X O
hysterectomised X X O

of X X O
tamoxifen X X B-CHEM
as X X O

METHODS X X O
: X X O
In X X O
October X X O
, X X O
1992 X X O
, X X O
we X X O
started X X O
a X X O

, X X O

who X X O
did X X O
not X X O
have X X O

and X X O
who X X O
had X X O
had X X O
a X X O

Women X X O
were X X O

The X X O

Tacrolimus X X B-CHEM

immunosuppressant X X O
that X X O
is X X O
frequently X X O
used X X O
in X X O

. X X O

However X X O
, X X O
adverse X X O
effects X X O
include X X O
cardiac X X B-DIS
toxicity X X I-DIS
. X X O

Herein X X O
we X X O
describe X X O
transient X X O
myocardial X X B-DIS
hypertrophy X X I-DIS
induced X X O
by X X O
tacrolimus X X B-CHEM
after X X O
heart X X O
transplantation X X O
. X X O

The X X O
hypertrophy X X B-DIS
caused X X O
no X X O
clinical X X O
symptoms X X O
but X X O
was X X O
noted X X O
because X X O
of X X O

and X X O
confirmed X X O
at X X O

. X X O

Initially X X O
, X X O
allograft X X O

was X X O
feared X X O
; X X O
however X X O
, X X O
myocardial X X O
biopsy X X O

revealed X X O
only X X O
interstitial X X O
edema X X B-DIS
and X X O
mild X X O
myocardial X X B-DIS
hypertrophy X X I-DIS
; X X O
neither X X O
cellular X X O
nor X X O
humoral X X O
rejection X X O
was X X O
detected X X O
. X X O

The X X O
blood X X O
tacrolimus X X B-CHEM
concentration X X O
was X X O
higher X X O
than X X O
usual X X O
at X X O
that X X O
time X X O
; X X O
thus X X O
, X X O
tacrolimus X X B-CHEM
dosage X X O
was X X O
reduced X X O
. X X O

Myocardial X X B-DIS
hypertrophy X X I-DIS
completely X X O
resolved X X O
upon X X O
reducing X X O
the X X O
target X X O
concentration X X O
of X X O
tacrolimus X X B-CHEM
and X X O
did X X O
not X X O
recur X X O
, X X O
as X X O
confirmed X X O
at X X O
echocardiography X X O
and X X O
myocardial X X O
biopsy X X O
. X X O

Thus X X O
, X X O
we X X O
conclude X X O
that X X O
tacrolimus X X B-CHEM
induces X X O
reversible X X O
myocardial X X B-DIS

. X X O

In X X O
patients X X O
receiving X X O

Eighteen X X O

The X X O

In X X O
this X X O

we X X O
encountered X X O
a X X O

who X X O
exhibited X X O

Previous X X O
conventional X X O

were X X O
not X X O
effective X X O
for X X O
this X X O

, X X O
thus X X O
this X X O

had X X O
been X X O

During X X O

also X X O
maintained X X O
even X X O
after X X O
the X X O

however X X O
, X X O
no X X O

. X X O

In X X O
particular X X O
, X X O
low X X O

reduced X X O
the X X O

to X X O
and X X O
prolonged X X O
the X X O

In X X O

, X X O
the X X O

of X X O
melatonin X X B-CHEM
( X X O

/ X X O

) X X O
caused X X O
a X X O
paradoxical X X O
increase X X O
in X X O
the X X O

and X X O
produced X X O
a X X O
sustained X X O
reduction X X O
of X X O
the X X O

of X X O

, X X O
and X X O

BACKGROUND X X O
: X X O
Hallucinations X X B-DIS
as X X O
a X X O

Most X X O

have X X O
been X X O
reported X X O

METHODS X X O
: X X O
The X X O
authors X X O
interviewed X X O
six X X O
persons X X O
with X X O
ifosfamide X X B-CHEM
- X X O
induced X X O
hallucinations X X B-DIS
in X X O
the X X O
presence X X O
of X X O
a X X O

. X X O

All X X O

were X X O

RESULTS X X O
: X X O

Underreporting X X O

CONCLUSIONS X X O
: X X O

The X X O

on X X O
two X X O

In X X O
group X X O

In X X O

Despite X X O

BACKGROUND X X O
: X X O
In X X O
recent X X O
studies X X O
increased X X O
amounts X X O
of X X O
nitric X X B-CHEM

( X X O

and X X O

been X X O
implicated X X O
in X X O
various X X O
pathological X X O
conditions X X O
in X X O
the X X O

. X X O

We X X O
have X X O
studied X X O
the X X O
role X X O
of X X O

and X X O
its X X O

with X X O

METHODS X X O
: X X O
The X X O

in X X O

was X X O
assessed X X O
by X X O
measuring X X O

These X X O

Histopathological X X O

with X X O

prevented X X O
the X X O
impairment X X O
of X X O

CONCLUSION X X O
: X X O
We X X O
suggest X X O
that X X O
interactions X X O
between X X O

are X X O
important X X O
in X X O

The X X O

is X X O

In X X O

that X X O

CONCLUSIONS X X O
: X X O

that X X O
fluconazole X X B-CHEM
, X X O
even X X O
at X X O
