Only X X O

: X X O
Our X X O

has X X O
indicated X X O
that X X O

In X X O

the X X O

, X X O

a X X O

these X X O
show X X O

, X X O
no X X O

had X X O

there X X O
is X X O
a X X O

that X X O

a X X O
well X X O
- X X O
known X X O
finding X X O
in X X O
some X X O
patients X X O
with X X O

However X X O
, X X O
it X X O
has X X O
not X X O

We X X O
report X X O
the X X O
occurrence X X O
of X X O

girl X X O
with X X O

who X X O
was X X O
given X X O
Imipramine X X B-CHEM
to X X O
control X X O

behavior X X B-DIS
disorder X X I-DIS
. X X O

It X X O
was X X O
determined X X O
later X X O
that X X O
this X X O
patient X X O
' X X O
s X X O
tumor X X B-DIS
was X X O
recurring X X O
at X X O
the X X O
time X X O
of X X O
her X X O
hypertensive X X B-DIS

. X X O

Since X X O
she X X O
had X X O
no X X O

when X X O

, X X O
we X X O
believe X X O
that X X O
this X X O
drug X X O
rather X X O
than X X O
her X X O
underlying X X O
disease X X O
alone X X O
caused X X O
her X X O
hypertension X X B-DIS
. X X O

The X X O
mechanism X X O
for X X O
this X X O
reaction X X O
is X X O
believed X X O
to X X O
be X X O
increased X X O
levels X X O
of X X O

due X X O
to X X O

of X X O

From X X O
this X X O

, X X O
we X X O
urge X X O
extreme X X O
caution X X O
in X X O
the X X O
use X X O
of X X O

in X X O

Thus X X O

displayed X X O
a X X O

Myotonia X X B-DIS

( X X O
MC X X B-DIS

is X X O
caused X X O
by X X O

When X X O

The X X O

OBJECTIVE X X O
: X X O
We X X O

All X X O

. X X O

The X X O

was X X O
considered X X O
positive X X O
if X X O
one X X O

RESULTS X X O
: X X O

CONCLUSION X X O
: X X O
Only X X O

PURPOSE X X O
: X X O
Despite X X O

, X X O
the X X O
anthracyclin X X O
doxorubicin X X B-CHEM
( X X O

continues X X O
to X X O
be X X O
an X X O
effective X X O
and X X O

chemotherapeutic X X O
agent X X O
. X X O

DOX X X B-CHEM
- X X O
induced X X O
cardiac X X B-DIS
damage X X I-DIS
presumably X X O
results X X O
from X X O
the X X O
formation X X O
of X X O

by X X O
DOX X X B-CHEM
. X X O

Reactive X X O
oxygen X X B-CHEM
species X X O
particularly X X O
affect X X O
the X X O
cardiac X X O
myocytes X X O
because X X O
these X X O

seem X X O
to X X O
have X X O
a X X O
relatively X X O
poor X X O
antioxidant X X O

. X X O

The X X O

showed X X O

through X X O

. X X O

Because X X O
of X X O
the X X O
relatively X X O
short X X O

of X X O
monoHER X X B-CHEM
( X X O
about X X O

, X X O
it X X O
is X X O
expected X X O
that X X O
the X X O

Therefore X X O
, X X O
the X X O
aim X X O
of X X O
the X X O

was X X O
to X X O

Because X X O

It X X O
has X X O

suggested X X O
that X X O

that X X O

However X X O
, X X O
the X X O

has X X O
never X X O
been X X O
quantified X X O

so X X O
it X X O
is X X O
unclear X X O
whether X X O

The X X O

Interestingly X X O
, X X O
the X X O
size X X O

appears X X O
to X X O
be X X O
correlated X X O
with X X O
the X X O
frequency X X O
of X X O

because X X O
animals X X O
with X X O

have X X O

The X X O

does X X O
not X X O
appear X X O

We X X O

examined X X O
the X X O

: X X O
Local X X O

CONCLUSIONS X X O
: X X O

The X X O

We X X O
hypothesized X X O
that X X O

may X X O
lead X X O
to X X O
altered X X O
mitochondrial X X O
function X X O
that X X O

Seven X X O

increased X X O
, X X O

In X X O

there X X O
was X X O
a X X O

whereas X X O
no X X O

However X X O
, X X O
a X X O

has X X O
been X X O
recently X X O
reported X X O

Here X X O
we X X O
had X X O
the X X O
opportunity X X O
to X X O
study X X O
a X X O

In X X O
this X X O
case X X O
, X X O
lymph X X O

biopsies X X O
were X X O
performed X X O
before X X O
and X X O
six X X O
months X X O
after X X O

therapy X X O
. X X O

Comparison X X O
of X X O
the X X O
two X X O
biopsies X X O
showed X X O
that X X O
temsirolimus X X B-CHEM
inhibited X X O
tumor X X B-DIS

through X X O

cycle X X O

, X X O
but X X O
did X X O
not X X O

any X X O

in X X O
the X X O
number X X O
of X X O

. X X O

Apart X X O
from X X O
this X X O
cytostatic X X O
effect X X O
, X X O
temsirolimus X X B-CHEM
had X X O
an X X O
antiangiogenic X X O
effect X X O
with X X O
decrease X X O
of X X O
tumor X X B-DIS

and X X O

Moreover X X O
, X X O

were X X O
found X X O
after X X O

Thus X X O
, X X O

This X X O

The X X O
